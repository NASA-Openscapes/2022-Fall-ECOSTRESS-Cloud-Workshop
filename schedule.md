- **Thank you!**
- JupyterHub: close out.  
  - close out your JupyterHub instance if you are finished for the day, following [these instructions](https://podaac.github.io/2022-SWOT-Ocean-Cloud-Workshop/tutorials/00_Setup.html#how-do-i-end-my-session).  
  
- You will continue to have access to the 2i2c JupyterHub in AWS for two weeks following the ECOSTRESS Cloud Workshop. You may use that time to continue work and all learn more about migrating data accass routines and science workflows to the Cloud. This cloud compute environment is supported by the [NASA Openscapes](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/) project. 

## Getting help during the Workshop

We will use the ECOSTRESS Slack Workspace as our main channels for help. Please use Slack to post questions.
